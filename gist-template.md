# Title (replace with your title)

As a fullstack software engineer student, I have developed a tutorial explaining a specifics of regex so that we can understand the search pattern the regex defines.

## Summary

A regex or regular expression are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These expressions are extremely useful for extracting data like phone numbers, emails, etc that follow a specific pattern from text, and they can be used in almost any programming language including JavaScript. It is a technique commonly developed in theoretical computer science.

We will look at a string of code using regex, this code looks for a match HTML tag.

Example: /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/
